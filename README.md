## Team 2
## Delivery Service App
We will create two apps that a user can select from a list of items and send them to a driver whow ill go out to collect the items and deliver. Some of these items will consist of prepared foods, groceries, and other miscellaneous items. We will include a location tracker to track the driver and a way to get in contact if necessary. Opening the app will bring the user to a screen to startselecting items. There will be a menu of different things to select from such as types. The usercan select items and add it to the cart and checkout there. Once it is submitted, we can have abroadcast to the other end who is the driver to receive it and on his end he can see the orderbreakdown and have a checklist to select off what items have been chosen already.
